# `mnist-digit-nn`
A simple neural network-based digit classifier based on the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). Written as an excerise to better understand backpropagation and neural networks. Largely inspired from [3Blue1Brown's series on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).
